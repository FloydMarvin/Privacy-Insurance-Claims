## Narration Script

Hello, I'm presenting Privacy Insurance Claims for the Zama FHEVM Bounty December 2025.

This is a privacy-preserving medical insurance system built with Fully Homomorphic Encryption.

The project includes a complete Hardhat repository with contracts, comprehensive tests, and automation scripts.

The smart contract demonstrates three key FHEVM concepts: encryption of sensitive medical data using euint types, fine-grained access control with FHE.allow and FHE.allowThis, and role-based permissions for insurance companies, reviewers, and policy holders.

The test suite includes over one hundred test cases with JSDoc annotations for automatic documentation generation.

The automation tools scaffold new FHEVM examples and generate GitBook-compatible documentation from code comments.

This real-world healthcare use case shows how to process insurance claims while maintaining complete patient privacy on-chain.

Thank you for reviewing my submission.
