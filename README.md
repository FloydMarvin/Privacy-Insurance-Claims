FHEVM Example: Privacy-Preserving Insurance Claims System with Encrypted Medical Data

## Overview

This is a comprehensive example of using FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine) for building privacy-preserving smart contracts.

## What is FHEVM?

FHEVM enables smart contracts to perform computations on encrypted data without decrypting it. This example demonstrates:

- **Encryption**: How to encrypt sensitive data using FHE
- **Access Control**: Managing who can access encrypted data
- **User Decryption**: Allowing users to decrypt their own data
- **Privacy-Preserving Operations**: Performing computations on encrypted values

## Testing

The test suite includes comprehensive tests for:

- Contract deployment and initialization
- Policy creation with encrypted data
- Claim submission with medical information
- Access control and authorization
- Claim review and approval workflows
- Payment processing
- Edge cases and security

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

## Security Considerations

This example demonstrates privacy-preserving patterns but should not be used in production without:

1. Professional security audit
2. Comprehensive access control review
3. Gas optimization
4. Integration with real payment systems
5. Compliance with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
